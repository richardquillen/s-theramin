## What is this app?
s-theramin is a simple theremin-like application that allows users to control musical notes using both touchscreen and analog controls. It provides a range of around an octave and a half.
You could also view this like a harmonica, where the y axis allows you to control how hard you blow. 
This may be a better analogy as the 3DS does not allow for controlling pitch and volume simultaenously like a genuine theramin.
Either way, check it out.

### Features
- **Touchscreen Controls:**
  - **X-axis:** Controls pitch.

### User Interface
the most basic interface I could throw together
